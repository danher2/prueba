When working with HTTP requests, headers play a crucial role in providing additional information about the request or the data being sent. The headers you mentioned—Content-Type, Content-Length, and Host—are commonly used in HTTP requests.

Content-Type: This header specifies the media type of the resource or data. It tells the server what type of data is being sent in the request body. For example, if you are sending JSON data, the Content-Type header might be set to application/json.

Content-Length: This header indicates the size of the request or response body in octets (8-bit bytes). It helps the server and client know the length of the content being sent or received.

Host: The Host header specifies the domain name and port number of the server to which the request is being sent. This is essential, especially in scenarios where a single server may host multiple domains.

If you are facing issues with your Postman request when removing these headers, it's likely because the server expects them to be present. Here's a brief explanation of why each header is important:

Content-Type: The server needs to know how to interpret the data in the request body. If you're sending JSON data, the server needs to expect JSON and parse it accordingly.

Content-Length: This header informs the server about the size of the request body. It helps the server know when it has received the complete request.

Host: This header is necessary, especially in virtual hosting environments, where multiple websites may be served from the same IP address. The server uses the Host header to determine which domain the request is intended for.

Now, if you want to replicate this behavior in Java, you can use libraries like HttpClient for making HTTP requests. Here's an example using HttpClient to set these headers:


import java.net.URI;
import java.net.http.HttpClient;
import java.net.http.HttpRequest;
import java.net.http.HttpResponse;

public class MyHttpClient {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        String url = "https://example.com/api";
        String requestBody = "{\"key\":\"value\"}";

        HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();

        HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
                .uri(URI.create(url))
                .header("Content-Type", "application/json")
                .header("Content-Length", String.valueOf(requestBody.length()))
                .header("Host", "example.com")
                .POST(HttpRequest.BodyPublishers.ofString(requestBody))
                .build();

        HttpResponse<String> response = client.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());

        System.out.println("Response Code: " + response.statusCode());
        System.out.println("Response Body: " + response.body());
    }
}



In this example, replace the url with your actual URL and requestBody with your JSON data. The headers are set using the header method. Note that the Content-Length header is calculated using the length of the request body string. Always remember to adjust the headers according to your specific use case
